Mad Men, created by Matthew Weiner, stars Jon Hamm as Don Draper, a charismatic but troubled ad man who struggles to balance his professional and personal lives.

The fifth season of Mad Men explores Don's new marriage to Megan (Jessica ParÃ©), a young and ambitious secretary who becomes a copywriter at the agency. The season also depicts the changing social and cultural landscape of the era, such as the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the rise of consumerism. The season received critical acclaim and won four Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series for the fourth consecutive year.
 
Netflix subscribers can binge-watch all 13 episodes of Mad Men Season 5 starting from March 25. The streaming service also offers the previous four seasons of the show, as well as the sixth and seventh seasons that concluded the series in 2015.

The fifth season of Mad Men has received critical acclaim from both critics and viewers. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 97% of 34 critics have given the season a positive review, with an average rating of 9.2 out of 10[^1^]. The site's consensus is: "With its brilliantly crafted characters, razor-sharp writing, and ambitious sweep, Mad Men continues to surprise and unsettle."[^1^]
 
The season was praised for its exploration of the changing social and cultural landscape of the era, as well as the complex and nuanced character development of the main cast. IGN's Eric Goldman gave the season an 8 out of 10, writing that "It was typically solid and had plenty of great moments to chew on."[^4^] He also highlighted the performances of Jon Hamm, Elisabeth Moss, Christina Hendricks, and Jared Harris as standouts. Slate's Troy Patterson called the season "a triumph of style and vision" and noted that "Mad Men still allows the characters' temptations to be authentically seductive."[^3^]
 
The season also received some criticism for its slow pace, dark tone, and lack of focus on some characters. The New York Times' Alessandra Stanley wrote that "At this point, the context may be more interesting than the characters."[^2^] She also criticized the show for being too self-conscious and predictable in its depiction of historical events. Newsday's Verne Gay gave the season a B+, but felt that it was "too long" and "too uneven". He also lamented the reduced screen time for Betty Draper (January Jones), who was sidelined by her pregnancy.[^2^]
 
Despite some flaws, Mad Men: Season 5 proved to be another masterful season of television that cemented the show's status as one of the best dramas of all time. The season won four Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series for the fourth consecutive year. It also received 17 nominations, more than any other series that year.[^1^]
