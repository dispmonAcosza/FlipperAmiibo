The film follows the hilarious misadventures of Sachin Tichkule (Akshay Kumar), an ambitious contractor who faces opposition from everyone, both at home and at work. He is constantly at loggerheads with his corrupt family members, his nagging wife (Trisha Krishnan), his dishonest boss (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and his ruthless rival (Milind Gunaji). He also has to deal with a series of mishaps that occur on his construction sites, such as collapsing bridges, leaking pipes and exploding gas cylinders.
 
Things get even more complicated when Sachin's childhood sweetheart (Urvashi Sharma), who is now a successful engineer, arrives in town to supervise a mega project. Sachin tries to impress her with his skills and charm, but ends up creating more chaos and confusion. Will Sachin ever be able to fulfill his dreams and win his love? Or will he remain a khatta meetha (sour and sweet) character in life?

The film is a remake of the 1978 Malayalam film Vellanakalude Nadu, which was also directed by Priyadarshan and starred Mohanlal and Shobana.

The film is slated to release on Diwali this year and will clash with some other big-budget films. However, the makers are confident that Khatta Meetha 3 will win the hearts of the audience with its khatta meetha flavour.
